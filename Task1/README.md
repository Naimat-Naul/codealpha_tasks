# **Hangman Game**

# Introduction

The **Hangman Game** is a text-based word-guessing game implemented in Python. It challenges players to guess a randomly selected word one letter at a time. The player is presented with a blank representation of the word, and they must guess the letters to uncover it. Incorrect guesses are penalized with a limited number of attempts. The game ends when the player successfully guesses the word or runs out of attempts.

## **Features**
- **Random Word Selection**: A variety of common words are selected randomly from a predefined list.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Displays the word as a series of underscores, updating with correct guesses.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures players enter valid, single alphabetic characters.
- **Limited Attempts**: Players are given 6 incorrect guesses to solve the word.
- **Win/Loss Conditions**: Displays appropriate messages when the player wins or loses.
